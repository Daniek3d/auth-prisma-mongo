    <p>This is an todo challenge. To-do api: Nodejs code challenge Intro The goal of this challenge is to build a simple To-Do api in NodeJS. You can use any code editor. You need to use Typescript and the ES6 version of ECMAScript. Server You have to create
        a server using Nodejs. You can use any framework, but it is optional. Architecture You will implement a REST API, which will consist of different layers depending on the particular concern each of them represents. For instance, a repository will
        only communicate with the database. In order to keep code clean and testeable, you should implement the Dependency Injection design pattern. For this you can use any dependency injection container library, Business Logic The api consists of a
        Todo List in which the user can create tasks, and be able to mark them as completed, not completed, delete or modify them. For this you should implement the endpoints that will call the CRUD operations. All the endpoints should be authenticated,
        in other words, only the user can see it’s own tasks. The user should be able to register and login. The authentication will use the Bearer Token authentication strategy. Database Each user and task should be stored in a database (can be of any
        type, relational or not relational database). You can use any ORM/ODM (optional). Rules ● Use Typescript ● Use ES6 version of Javascript ● Use different layers in the applications depending on the concern of each one. ● Use Dependency Injection
        design pattern. ● Implement a database. Delivery Steps Create a repo on GitHub with the corresponding readme explaining how to run the app and send to us the public link. Nice to have, but optional: you can implement docker. Please give us 1-2
        days for challenge review. When the code challenge passes, we need another interview to show us the demo and explain the solution implemented.
